# Building images
# we're already seen the basic 
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> .
#  NOTE that 
#      <NAME> is usually of the form <username>/<repository>  eg smartyworld/primes-app 
#      <TAG>  is usually something like :v0.1 - but if you don't specify anything, it'll default to   :latest
#      thus 
docker image build -t smartyworld/primes-app:v1.0
# Other flag that are useful to know are:
#   -f,  --file-string     : Name of the Dockerfile (particularly if kept in a different place to the current working directory)
#        --force-rm        : Always remove intermediate containers
#        --rm              : Removes intermediate containers after a successful build 
#        --label           : set metadata for an image eg   --label com.smartyworld.version=v1.5
#        --ulimit          : ulimit options     fers to "user limits" and controls maximum memory consumption, CPU time, numbe rof processes etc          
# We can also pipe a Dockerfile through stdin eg
$ docker image build -t smartyworld/primes-app:stdintag --rm -<<EOF
> FROM nginx:latest
> VOLUME ["/usr/share/nginx/html/"]
> EOF
# We can also using remote urls (where Dockerfiles are hosted)- most commonly git
#    docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#<REF>                       # where <REF> can be a branch or a git tag 
# Alternative method is to point at a directory on master branch
#    docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#:<DIRECTORY>                # where <DIRECTORY> is the subdirectory that the Dockerfile is in 
# You can of course use BOTH at once
#    docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#<REF>:<DIRECTORY>
# Final way is to use a tar file ("tape archive")
#    docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> - < <FILE>.tar.gz
#  NOTE that the TAR file should contain both the src directory with all the source code in it as well as the Dockerfile 
# for example, assuming we have a tar file like this called primes-app.tar then;
docker image build -t smartyworld/primes-app:from-tar-tag - < primes-app.tar.gz
