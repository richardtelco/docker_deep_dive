# docker started as a paas cloud called dotcloud
# docker can mean:
# - Docker Inc (company)
# - docker - the container runtime application
# - docker - the opensource project - "moby" -- github.com/moby/moby
# 2 editions:
#  - community - free and none of the below
#  - enterprise - $$ inlcuding supplier, plugins and container scanning

# use cases:
# - dev/prd parity
# - decouple infrastructure/envs from the application code
# - code pipeline mgt
# - app developer productivity (less time spent farting about with envs and configs thereof
# - app isolation - apps run seperately from one another
# - server consolidation - uses server resources more efficiently
# - multi-tenancy (because apps/containers can run in isolation on the same server)
