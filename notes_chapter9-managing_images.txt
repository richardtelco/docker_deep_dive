# docker image command allows us to see how an image was built
# including the layers - whether they can from:
#    - the base image 
#    - ...or the layers in the Dockerfile 
docker image history node:latest
# This will show us all the layers and what created them. Will inlcude those that created the base image as well as the ones that were added in the Dockerfile 
# Can use --quiet flag to limit the output to just the imageids of the images that were created at each layer
docker image history --quiet smartyworld/primes-app:12664205120701
#
# Might also want to export an image to a tar file (if you want to avoid public repos)
# Use docker image save command...
docker image save smartyworld/primes-app:latest --output primes-app-latest.tar
# note to remember - we can look at hte contents of the tarfile using tar command
tar tvf primes-app-latest.tar
gzip primes-app-latest.tar
# can also load in the image from a tar file using docker image load command
docker image load --input primes-app-latest.tar.gz
